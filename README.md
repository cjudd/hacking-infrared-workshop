s# Invisible Technology: Hacking with Infrared Workshop

![Infrared and Remote](images/IR_and_remote.png "Infrared and Remote")

Infrared (IR) is a truly invisible technology, yet it powers many of the devices we use every day—from TV remotes and motion detectors to robots and security systems.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll uncover the hidden world of infrared communication. Using Arduino, you’ll learn how IR signals are sent and received, visualize invisible signals on your computer, and use them to control real-world devices.

This workshop blends electronics, coding, and ethical hacking to show how everyday technology really works.

Recommended Age - 12+  
Skill Level - Beginner-friendly (no prior Arduino experience required) 
Approx. Cost - $9-20 per student (hardware varies)
