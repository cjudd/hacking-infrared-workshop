# Infrared Hacking

Infrared (IR) is a form of light that sits just beyond what the human eye can see. Even though it’s invisible to us, infrared is everywhere and plays a huge role in everyday technology—TV remotes, motion sensors, automatic doors, security systems, and even some medical devices all rely on infrared signals to work.

Arduino boards are perfect tools for learning about infrared because they let you interact with the physical world using code. With Arduino, you can both send infrared signals (using an IR LED) and receive infrared signals (using an IR receiver). This means you can build projects that understand remote controls, trigger actions when something moves nearby, or control devices wirelessly using invisible light.

At a basic level, infrared communication works by turning an IR LED on and off very quickly in specific patterns. These patterns represent information, such as which button was pressed on a remote control. An Arduino can read these patterns, decode them, and decide what to do next—or it can generate its own patterns to control other devices.
